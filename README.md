🚀 GFG_160  

Welcome to **GFG_160**, a project where I explore and implement solutions to 160 essential coding problems from **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**.
This repo is all about sharpening problem-solving skills and becoming a coding ninja! 🥋  

## 📂 What’s Inside?  
- **160 Problems**  
   A carefully curated list of problems covering various **data structures** and **algorithms**.  
- **Solutions**  
   Each problem has a well-documented solution with clear explanations.  
- **Code in C++**  
   The solutions are written in **Python**, focusing on clean, efficient, and readable code.  

## ✨ Why This Repo?  
- To strengthen the basics of data structures and algorithms.  
- To provide a reference for GFG problems and their optimal solutions.  
- To serve as a personal milestone tracker for solving these coding challenges.  

## 🛠️ Tools and Languages Used  
- **Language**: Python 
- **Platform**: GeeksforGeeks  

## 📝 How to Use It?  
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ayushraj022/GFG_160.git  
   ```  
2. Browse through the problem files in the repository.  
3. Each file corresponds to a specific problem and contains:  
   - Problem statement (inline comments).  
   - The solution with a step-by-step approach.  
4. Run the code using any C++ IDE or a simple terminal setup with g++:
